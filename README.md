## What is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system that allows you to track changes in your codebase, revert to previous stages, work on different branches, and collaborate with other developers.

## Git Configuration

```

## Behind The Name

Torvalds referred to Git as the "stupid content tracker" and the name "Git" is a British slang term for "unpleasant person".

The official Git source code explains a couple different meanings for the name, depending on your mood:

- random three-letter combination that is pronounceable, and not actually meaningful
- "global information tracker": you're in a good mood, and it actually works for you. Angels sing, and a light suddenly fills the room
- stupid. contemptible and despicable. simple.
- *God damn idiotic truckload of sh*t\*
